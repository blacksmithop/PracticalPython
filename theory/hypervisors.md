# ðŸªž Hypervisors

Virtual Private Servers or VPS are virtual environments on a physical server. The resources on such a server are virtualized and hence can be modified on demand. This is made possible by making use of a software layer called the Hypervisor.

&#x20;A hypervisor is essentially a virtual layer on top of the Operating System that divides the physical server into virtual compartments. These virtual servers utilize a portion of the host's resources to function.

VPS hosting is often more affordable than a dedicated/cloud server.

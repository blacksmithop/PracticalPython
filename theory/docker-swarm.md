# 🐝 Docker Swarm

Before we get into using Kubernetes it helps to have a basic understanding of Container Orchestration. Docker Swarm offers automatic load balancing for your containers.

This is achieved by running your different instances over multiple nodes. Even if one of your hosts do go down the service would still be running.&#x20;

A Swarm consists of two kinds of nodes, managers and workers.

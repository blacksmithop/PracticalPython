# ðŸªž Hypervisors explained

You might have heard of Virtual Private Servers or VPS for short. Many cloud providers offer VPS services at relatively cheap rates. You might wonder how they do that since the computer offered often has a fraction of the specs you would expect in an actual server.

This is where Virtualization comes into play. You have a Host Server or just the Server with the associated CPU, RAM, and Networking infrastructure. What they do is provide access to Virtual Servers on top of that.

Now these VPS make use of a portion of the resources of the host server to function and this is made possible through the Hypervisor.

The Hypervisor in simple terms is the software layer that makes virtualization possible.

# ‚ùì Why use containers

Before Docker was a thing microservices were deployed using Virtualization. Individual VM's were used to run each service and as you can see it is a huge waste of resources.

We had this host Operating System on top of which sit a Hypervisor. We run our VM's on top of this.

As you can see each VM needs an Operating System as well libraries to function. When you have multiple VMs this adds up to a lot of resources.



With Containers resource sharing is much more flexible and ununsed resources are shared among the other containers.

## Why use CNNs?

A typical Neural Network consists of three layers

A Input layer, a Hidden layer where computations of the inputs are done, and,  the Output layer.

Neural Networks do great at recognizing patterns much like the human brain. They work great for most tasks unless those happen to fall under language or image processing.

This is where CNNs shine

# Transfer Learning 101

Let's say we have a Machine Learning model that is supposed to tell us whether a Cat is black or not. It does its job very well and doesn't mix up colors.

What if we wanted the same model to tell us whether a particular black cat has stripes as well? Obviously training another ML model for this is not only time-consuming but redundant as well.

This is where Transfer Learning comes in, we take a model trained to do a certain task and teach it to do a related task.

# ðŸ–– Build a lightweight docker image

For most Python apps it is often enough to simply use a `slim-buster` [image ](https://hub.docker.com/\_/python)or even an `alpine` one.&#x20;

However, sometimes you need an additional package or two that doesn't come with these images.

While you could sometimes work your way around some issues by having a file locally, download a .deb file or so, it is not always possible. It is all too easy to end up with a messy `Dockerfile`



We can avoid many such pitfalls by starting off from a slim OS image like [`alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/\_/alpine)

# ðŸ§  Neural Networks

A typical Neural Network consists of three layers

When learning about Neural Networks it helps to think of Neurons which are its building blocks. While Neurons in a network might not have a myelin sheath, axons or the rest of the biological machinery they still fire much like a biological neuron.

Much of what we expect from a NN is based on _when_ and _how_ those neurons fire.

The architecture of a Neural Network is as simple as it gets.

1. &#x20;Input Layer

You have an Input layer that takes a certain input. You apply a certain weight on these inputs to determine the influence particular input has on the network

2. &#x20;Hidden Layer

Next comes the Hidden layer where the function often referred to as the _Activation function_ resides. This is where weights get 'applied' to the inputs. In effect, this is simulating the activity that goes on in a human brain.

3. &#x20;Output Layer

The function of any NN is to predict a certain value. This could be classifying whether an image is a cat or determining whether the probability of someone defaulting on a loan is high. Neurons in this layer fire and the one with the highest probability determines the output.
